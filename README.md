# MiRNA_prediction_2019

Description:
This project encompasses three R files:

DNA_analysis.R: Performs a basic analysis of a genomic table.
Modelo_estr_sec.R: Builds a prediction model for pre-miRNAs based on structural features.
Matrizh.R: Contains an alternative model for pre-miRNA prediction utilizing a machine learning sigmoid function.
File Descriptions:

DNA_analysis.R: Analyzes genomic data, calculates correlations, creates heatmaps, and evaluates pre-miRNA classes using linear and logistic regression.

Modelo_estr_sec.R: Constructs a predictive model for pre-miRNAs based on their structural features, including correlation analysis, visualization creation, and logistic regression modeling.

Matrizh.R: Implements a machine learning sigmoid function to enhance pre-miRNA prediction, conducting feature reduction through principal component analysis (PCA) and analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
